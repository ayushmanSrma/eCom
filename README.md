Getting Started
Prerequisites
Flutter installed on your machine: Install Flutter
Strapi: Install and configure Strapi on your local machine or deploy it on the cloud.
Meilisearch: Install Meilisearch and configure it to index your Strapi content.
Kubernetes: Set up a Kubernetes cluster to deploy the app. Alternatively, use a service like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or AWS EKS.
Installation
1. Clone the repository:
'''
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snapnews.git
cd snapnews
'''
2. Install Flutter dependencies:
'''
flutter pub get
'''
3. Update the API URLs in your project files:

Update the Strapi API URL in the Flutter code to point to your Strapi instance.
Update the Meilisearch URL and API key for your search functionality.
4. Run the app on your emulator or device:
'''
flutter run
'''
Backend (Strapi)
1. Install Strapi dependencies:
'''
   yarn install
'''
2. Run the Strapi development server:
'''
yarn develop
'''
3. Make sure the Strapi CMS is correctly configured with your content types (e.g., news articles).

Search Engine (Meilisearch)
1. Run Meilisearch in a Docker container:
'''
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 7700:7700 \
  getmeili/meilisearch
'''
2. Index your Strapi content with Meilisearch using the Strapi-Meilisearch plugin or via direct API integration.

Deployment
Deploy the application using Kubernetes for scalability:

1. Build the Docker image for the Flutter app and push it to your container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
'''
docker build -t yourusername/snapnews-app .
docker push yourusername/snapnews-app
'''
2. Create a Kubernetes deployment and service for your Flutter app:
'''
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: snapnews
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: snapnews
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: snapnews
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: snapnews
        image: yourusername/snapnews-app
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: snapnews-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: snapnews
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
'''
3. Apply the configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:
'''
kubectl apply -f kubernetes_deployment.yaml
'''
